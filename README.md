## R tools for putting open source, California water resource spatial data into a common framework (.csv and raster bricks) for statistical analysis and hydrologic modeling 

Processing data from these open-sources:
1. TopoWx http://www.scrimhub.org/resources/topowx/
2. PRISM http://www.prism.oregonstate.edu/
3. SSURGO https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/soils/survey/?cid=nrcs142p2_053627
4. NLCD 2011 https://www.mrlc.gov/nlcd2011.php
5. FRAP-FVEG http://frap.fire.ca.gov/data/frapgisdata-sw-fveg_download
6. DEMs
7. Station climate data https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search?datasetid=GHCND  

Purpose: These R scripts are very specific to my dissertation research at UC Davis, but feel free to use them at your own discretion.   At this stage, you will have to download the data locally 
on to your own machines and modify the directory definitions at the beginning of each script.  Depending on the script, they will automatically generate results directories and results when
executed.
